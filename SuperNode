Determining whether a Client is a Super Node
To check whether an Endpoint Security Client has been configured as a Super Node, open the Windows Task Manager. There should be two instances of the nginx.exe process, running as  acpnginx user.
Starting with E85.30 version you can also use following registry entries:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CheckPoint\Endpoint Security\Device Agent\SuperNode - if this REG_DWORD value exists and is set to 1 then current Endpoint is successfully configured as Super Node.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CheckPoint\Endpoint Security\Device Agent\SuperNodeLocations - this REG_SZ entry contains list of available Super Node download locations. When this list is empty Client will not use download from Super Node feature.

Get-Item -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CheckPoint\Endpoint` Security\Device` Agent\
Get-Process nginx -IncludeUserName
