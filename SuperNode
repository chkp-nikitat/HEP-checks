Any endpoint can be a Super Node, there are no additional requirements
Super Node is designed in a way it will not interfere with the day-to-day work of the machine by applying limits to disk size, number of connections and bandwidth usage
So as long as the machine is capable of running endpoint client it can be a Super Node
However, the numbers of how many machines per Super Node is effected by the Super Node itself
As a rule of thumb, I would recommend up to 1000 machines per super node and let the machine be a permanent machine such as a local server or a high end desktop

Determining whether a Client is a Super Node
To check whether an Endpoint Security Client has been configured as a Super Node, open the Windows Task Manager. There should be two instances of the nginx.exe process, running as  acpnginx user.
Starting with E85.30 version you can also use following registry entries:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CheckPoint\Endpoint Security\Device Agent\SuperNode - if this REG_DWORD value exists and is set to 1 then current Endpoint is successfully configured as Super Node.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CheckPoint\Endpoint Security\Device Agent\SuperNodeLocations - this REG_SZ entry contains list of available Super Node download locations. When this list is empty Client will not use download from Super Node feature.

Get-Item -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\CheckPoint\Endpoint` Security\Device` Agent\
Get-Process nginx -IncludeUserName
